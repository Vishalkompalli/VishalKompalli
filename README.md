**Embedded Software Engineer | AUTOSAR MCAL FEE | RTOS**  

**Actively seeking full-time opportunities as an embedded software/firmware engineer.**  
At Infineon Technologies, I contributed to developing a robustness test framework for the Flash EEPROM (FEE), ensuring data integrity during power fluctuations. This involved creating controlled test environments and comprehensive test cases, along with leveraging Python for data logging and analysis to validate memory algorithms under adverse conditions.   
I am eager to apply my embedded system expertise and passion for innovation to real-world technological challenges.  

I graduated Master of Engineering (ME) in Embedded Systems at the Manipal School of Information Sciences, MAHE. My academic focus includes C programming, Microcontrollers, operating Systems, complemented by a Bachelor's in Electrical and Electronics Engineering.
